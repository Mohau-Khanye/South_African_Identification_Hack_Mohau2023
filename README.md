# South_African_Language_Identification
This project focuses on identifying languages within a diverse, multilingual dataset using machine learning. Given South Africaâ€™s linguistic diversity, the ability to accurately classify language in text is crucial for effective communication and technological inclusivity. The dataset contains over 33,000 samples of text across multiple languages spoken in South Africa.
